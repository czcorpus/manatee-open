''' requires finlib >= 2.11 '''

New Features:

 * enhanced {{{corpquery}}} script which makes it possible to specify (via command-line options) reference attribute, context, limit for the number of results and structures and attributes to be printed
 * new {{{parse2wmap}}} tool for generating sketches (data for wmap) from a positional attribute
 * {{{ngrsave}}} can now print document IDs of duplicate n-grams instead of n-grams and number of documents
 * after the compilation, {{{compilecorp}}} checks for temporary files that indicate an error
 * enhancements to the CQL:
  * new "==" and "!==" operators that perform a match against fixed string (i.e. not a regular expression)[[BR]]
    Note that with two exceptions of "\"" and "\\" no expansions are performed
    on the string.[[BR]]
    Examples:[[BR]]
    ".", "$", "~" matches a single dot, dollar sign and tilda, respectively,[[BR]]
    "\n" matches a backslash followed by the character n,[[BR]]
    "\"\\" matches a double-quotes character followed by a single backslash[[BR]]
  * a {{{meet/union}}} query can occur at any position in the query and they are not introduced by the "MU" keyword, which is deprecated and raises an error
  * old {{{within <str>}}} syntax has been already deprecated (in favor of consistent {{{within <str/>}}} and now raises an error as well
  * support for inequality matching using new operators: "<=", "!<=", ">=", "!>=". The comparison on a string is performed in a way that compares numeric parts numerically and alphabetical parts alphabetically.
    Examples:[[BR]] 
    {{{[word>="cake"]}}} matches "cake" as well as "came",[[BR]]
    {{{<doc id<="145UA01">}}} matches e.g. 145UA01, 143UA01, 145TA00 etc.
  * {{{meet/union}}} queries can use numeric labels and be subject to global conditions as any other query parts -- e.g. {{{(meet 1:[] 2:[]) & 1.tag = 2.tag;}}}
  * a frequency function (denoted simply as {{{f}}}) can be used as part of the query together with numeric labels -- e.g. {{{1:[] & f(1.word) >= 1000;}}}

Bugfixes:

 * encodevert -v works again
 * encodevert can again read piped input data ("| <command>" in VERTICAL in corpus configuration file)
 * CQL queries using parallel corpora notation work again

 * encodevert doesn't crash if no attributes are given in the configuration fail nor command-line

=== 2.31.3 ===

 * FIX: compilecorp fails because of genhist.py which should be genhist
 * FIX: strip spaces in all attribute values
 * FIX: make dist* targets work again
