An input for the genws program is a word sketches definition file.
It is a text (ASCII) file containing Manatee queries for each 
grammatical relation (gramrel).

Comments are lines beginning with the sharp character (#).
Empty lines are ignored.

Lines beginning with the equal character (=) are gramrel names.
A gramrel name can contain any character with the exception of
slash (/) for dual gramrels (see below), trailing white spaces
are stripped off.

Gramrel name is followed by gramrel queries, each query on
a separate line. 
A regular gramrel query have to contain two labeled positions with
labels `1' and `2'.  One query should be on one line, use a backslash 
(\) on the end of a line to split a query to multiple lines.

Lines beginning with star (*) are processing directives.  They
modify handling of following lines.

*DEFAULTATTR sets the default attribute for query evaluation.
    This directive is active to the end of the file or to the next
    *DEFAULTATTR directive.

*STRUCTLIMIT limits query results to a structure, for example
    sentence.  The sequence of tokens in the result cannot cross
    boundaries of the structure.  This directive is active to the
    end of the file or to the next *STRUCTLIMIT directive.

*SYMMETRIC evaluates queries also with the `1' and `2' labels
    swapped. This directive is active up to the next gramrel line.

*DUAL is similar to *SYMMETRIC but it affect gramrels.  It defines
    two gramrels from the same set of gramrel queries.  Gramrel
    names are separated by a slash (/).  All queries are evaluated
    for the first gramrel and then for the second gramrel with the
    `1' and `2' labels swapped.

*UNARY says that the following gramrel is an unary relation.  Only
    one label is used for unary gramrel queries.

*TRINARY is used for trinary relations. These are translated into
    regular binary relations with different names.  A name of a
    trinary gramrel should contain `%s' and respective queries should
    contain third label `3'.  A value of the word sketch base
    attribute on the position labeled `3' is then substituted for `%s'
    in the gramrel name.

*SEPARATEPAGE says that the follwing TRINARY relation should be
    displayed on a separate page with only links from the main
    wordsketch page. Optional parameter is the name of the aggregated
    gramrel name, defaults to the relation name with %s substituted to '*'.

*COLLOC specifies a created value for the collocation.
    It could contain '%' substitution strings, in the form
    '%(n.attr)', where n is the numeric label used in the query,
    and attr is the attribute name.  It use a created value for the
    collocation instead of the attribute given by the WSATTR option.

*CONSTRUCTION indicates that the following gramrel should be displayed
    in the 'Constructions' list. Optional

# The following line sets the default attribute to `tag' so you can
# write only `"NN1"' instead of `[tag="NN1"]'.

# The following line limits all query results to sentences.
