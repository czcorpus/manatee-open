I am pleased to announce that Manatee version 1.11 is now
available. This is the first public release.

The Manatee system is a collection of programs for text corpora
indexing, querying, browsing and statistic computations. It includes
a nice graphical user interface Bonito.

Manatee could serve as a direct replacement for the Corpus Workbench
(CQP) from the Stuttgart University, Manatee uses similar format of
input texts and almost same query language.  It is also possible to
convert CQP corpora into Manatee binary format using the `importcqp'
utility included in the distribution.

You are invited to visit
    http://www.textforge.cz/
for a more complete description of what Manatee is, and access 
to the download files.
